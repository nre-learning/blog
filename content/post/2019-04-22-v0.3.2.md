Yesterday we pushed a small update, v0.3.2. This only included a few minor fixes to the platform - the main highlight here are three new workflow lessons that focus on using PyEZ, Jinja, YAML, and other tools to accomplish very common workflows that are especially useful in environments where configuration and operational consistency is crucial to the outcome of the business objective or other mission.

As a result, this will be a short blog post. The changelog is below, but please check out the three new lessons:

- [Automated Device Inventory](https://labs.networkreliability.engineering/labs/?lessonId=33&lessonStage=1)
- [Automated Configuration Backup](https://labs.networkreliability.engineering/labs/?lessonId=34&lessonStage=1)
- [Device-Specific Template Generation](https://labs.networkreliability.engineering/labs/?lessonId=35&lessonStage=1)
