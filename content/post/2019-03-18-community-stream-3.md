In this week's community stream, Derick and Matt had a great discussion about a lot of platform-specifics, including a new tool
that will allow you to locally validate lesson content, and much more.

> Unfortunately Derick's audio didn't connect to the livestream successfully this time, so you'll just hear Matt on the recording. We're posting the video anyways, in case it's useful as-is, but we'll be sure to get the audio issues fixed for next time.
