Following NRELabs [Community Stream #21](https://youtu.be/9uYrbueIsL0), we thought it would be a good idea to list the various Network Automation and Cloud Networking certifications available today.  Network Automation and Cloud Networking are becoming valuable skillsets.  These certifications offer a path for Network Engineers who want to dabble in the dark art of software engineering.

Before heading down this path, be aware that software engineering, DevOps, and automation are vast topics.  The training for these certifications provide a brief introduction to a large set of topics, each of which other engineers have built entire careers out of.  The knowledge gained in the preparation for these certifications should be thought of as a foundation for further learning.  There is a great deal of training available on virtually all the topics covered by these certifications, and anyone getting serious about a specific topic or tool is encouraged to explore what is being offered.  However, if you really want to succeed in this network specialization, then you must learn how to train yourself through experimentation and by leveraging the innumerable resources available on the internet.  Having a solid mentor never hurts, either!

Having said all that, here are the certs with links, and some text from the official sites:

### Network Automation

#### Juniper

[Automation and Devops Certification Track](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification/certification-tracks/devops?tab=jnciadevops)

The Juniper Networks Certification Program (JNCP) Automation and DevOps Track allows participants to demonstrate competence with common scripting languages and tools through the automation of device and network functions. Successful candidates demonstrate understanding of applying automation to Junos devices and networks.

#### Cisco

[DevNet Certification](https://developer.cisco.com/certification/)

Cisco’s certification and training program now includes DevNet certifications and is designed for both the network professionals and software developers to optimize and write applications for the new network and choose the technology skills they want to develop.

#### Arista

[Arista Certified Engineer - Professional](https://solutions.arista.com/ace-p-ape-exam)

The goal of this exam is to test the candidate's knowledge of Arista automation using eAPI and Python. The candidate is expected to know how to configure eAPI on Arista switches, how to extend the functionality of Arista's EOS, and how to code general Python scripts with a focus on understanding the Arista-specific Python and eAPI functionality.


### Cloud Networking

#### Juniper

[Cloud Certification Track](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification/certification-tracks/cloud-track?tab=jncia-cloud)

The Juniper Networks Certification Program (JNCP) Cloud Track allows participants to demonstrate competence with cloud networking architectures such as multiclouds, software-defined networking, SD-WAN, and other cloud technologies. Successful candidates demonstrate understanding of the deployment, implementation, and configuration of various Juniper Networks cloud technologies.

#### Google

[Professional Cloud Network Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-network-engineer)

A Professional Cloud Network Engineer implements and manages network architectures in Google Cloud Platform. This individual has at least 1 year of hands-on experience working with Google Cloud Platform and may work on networking or cloud teams with architects who design the infrastructure. By leveraging experience implementing VPCs, hybrid connectivity, network services, and security for established network architectures, this individual ensures successful cloud implementations using the command line interface or the Google Cloud Platform Console.

#### Amazon

[AWS Certified Advanced Networking - Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty/)

The AWS Certified Advanced Networking – Specialty (ANS-C00) is intended for individuals who perform complex networking tasks. This examination validates advanced technical skills and experience in designing and implementing AWS and hybrid IT network architectures at scale.
