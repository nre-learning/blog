Primarily this release includes a new chapter a [new chapter for the Git lesson, which covers "Fixing Your Mistakes"](https://go.nrelabs.io/labs/?lessonSlug=git-version-control&lessonStage=3). Everyone makes mistakes, and this is especially true when using a complex and robust tool like Git. We're continuing this lesson's mission to arm infrastructure professionals with the practical basics of using Git in a real-world environment.

## Stay Safe

Finally, I also want to express my heartfelt appreciation for those working to keep the lights on during the coronavirus pandemic. Healthcare workers are obviously top-of-mind for me right now, but also retail workers, and the myriad of IT professionals that are keeping things running smoothly despite seeing unprecedented explosions in user activity.

I'm also mindful of the multitude of folks that are now finding themselves working from home, which for many is **not** a comfortable environment to work in. It's unfamiliar, and given that everyone else has to be home too, is also full of distractions like stir-crazy children. The reality is that this current situation **isn't normal "work from home"**, it's "work during pandemic". No one is used to this.

Most of us don't have time to dig into a full-blown textbook on a subject. We have moments - fleeting minutes where we can play around with something new, and plant the seed of knowledge. My hope is that NRE Labs continues to provide a fast, and easy way to keep your skills sharp without requiring you to spend hours just building a lab environment. [Take a look at the lesson catalog](https://go.nrelabs.io/catalog) and check back in often to see the updates we're rolling into the curriculum every month.
